## Prediction of Airline Passenger Satisfaction using Classification Models

### Overview

In this project, we are going to work on a dataset that contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey. The project aimed to build a classification model to predict whether the airline passengers are satisfied or not and see if the model gives us a good accuracy or not.
Also, to identify the features are highly correlated to a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger?
